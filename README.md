  Pretrained SPQAR can be found [here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Supplement_Code_947/model_best.pth).

  

  Our reference Baseline model we use can be found [here](https://github.com/DoubtedSteam/MPANet.git). And the model checkpoints they provide is here: [[Baidu drive]] (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TnjtfMFPnm5TEprgAhqz9A).



- Download datasets

  In our experiment we use SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets for evaluation. Because we do not own the datasets,  you need to download them yourself. 
The edge profile dataset was generated by [EDTER](https://github.com/MengyangPu/EDTER.git).You can generate an auxiliary dataset for a dataset in this way

 
## Usage

```bash
python train.py --cfg ./configs/RegDB.yml
```
